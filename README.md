### The Game
How well do you know your friends? Do you know what songs they have listened to over and over again?

Each year, Spotify releases a playlist with your most played songs - Spotify Wrapped. This is the perfect opportunity to test how well you and your friends really know each other. With this Python script, you can create a playlist with all of your friends top songs. Press play, and let the guessing game begin!

The game is simple: play the song, and when you feel ready, let everyone point at the person they think had this song on their Spotify Wrapped. 

### The script
I created this script to avoid the possible spoilers that can happen when you try to play this game using a collaborative playlist. Now, you can simply add the usernames of the people who wants to join, select the playlist to get the songs from, and select a number of songs. The playlist is shuffled and ready to go!
